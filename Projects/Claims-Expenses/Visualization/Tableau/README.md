# Expense Claims Visualization – Step 2

## Introduction

This is **Step 2** of a larger expense claims project.  

- **Step 1** involved using **Python in Google Colab** to automate the preparation, cleaning, and categorization of an expense claims CSV file. You can view **[Step 1: Expense Claims Automation with Python](https://github.com/MeryemCiftciAly/my-python-journal/blob/main/Projects/Claims-Expenses/README.MD)** to explore the workflow and access the interactive Google Colab demo.  

- **Step 2**, this step, focuses on **visualizing the prepared expense claims data in Tableau**. The goal of the dashboard is to give stakeholders a clear view of where the organization may be overspending across different categories, currencies, and approvers.

## Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard was designed with the following objectives:

- **Catch spending trends** over time and across categories.
- **Highlight pending, approved, and rejected expenses** for quick decision-making.
- Provide a **multi-currency and category breakdown**.
- Enable stakeholders to **interact with filters** and explore insights by year, month, currency, and category.

For a detailed explanation of the dashboard elements, user guidance, and possible insights, please refer to the **[Dashboard Guide & Guided Analysis](link-to-dashboard-readme-or-guide)**.

## Why This Matters

- Stakeholders can quickly identify **overspending or unusual expense patterns**.
- Provides **drill-down capabilities** for category, approver, and currency-level insights.
- Helps **streamline the approval process** and monitor rejected or pending expenses.
- Complements the automated Python workflow from Step 1, bridging the gap from raw data to actionable insights.

## Next Steps

After reviewing this dashboard:

1. Stakeholders can explore **interactive trends** and make informed decisions.
2. Analysts can refer to the **Dashboard Guide & Guided Analysis** for **how-to-use instructions** and a breakdown of insights.
3. This workflow forms a **repeatable process** for ongoing expense tracking and reporting.
