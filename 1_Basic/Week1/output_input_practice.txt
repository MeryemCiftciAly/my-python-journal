This is a comment:
# Note: In Python, user input received via the input() function is not captured in redirected text output files.
# This is because input() requires real-time user interaction, and when output is redirected, that interaction is lost.
# Only explicitly assigned (static) variables are captured in the output.
# For illustration, the code below simulates what the dynamic input would have looked like if assigned directly.

Enter your name: You are 
 comes from Jamaica

Simulated Output Example:
You are Meryem. Meryem comes from Jamaica.
