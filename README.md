# My Python Journal

Hi, this is Meryem — welcome to my Python journey.

This repository documents my daily Python practice as I transition from over five years in administrative and operational roles into the world of data. It marks the beginning of what I hope to be a successful and fulfilling career as a data professional.

## 📚 Learning Structure

I’m following a structured and credible learning path guided by expert resources including:

- [Data With Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa) – Led by Baraa Khatib-Salkini, a data engineer with over a decade of experience and a clear, beginner-friendly teaching style.
- [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

These sources guide my hands-on practice and weekly progression, which is organized by concept rather than rigid timelines (e.g., “Week 1” includes beginner content, which may span multiple sessions).

## 📁 Repo Structure

Each Python file is accompanied by an `.md` file that contains the script's output, making it easy to follow the results of each practice session.

Week1/
│
├── hello.py # My first Python script
├── comments.py # Exploring print and comments
├── hello_output.md # Output from hello.py
└── comments_output.md # Output from comments.py


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

My Python learning focuses on tools and skills relevant to real-world data roles:

- Writing clean, readable Python code
- Data manipulation with `pandas` and `NumPy`
- Automating tasks with scripting
- Working with files and user input
- Preparing for eventual use with SQL, APIs, Power BI/Tableau, and cloud data tools
